                My name is Kenneth Luce. I am born and raised in South Florida,
                graduated from Port Saint Lucie High School in 2006,
                and attended Indian River State College for Graphic Design from 2006 - 2009.
            </p>
            <br>
            <p>
                I am married to my beautiful wife Alex, since 4/13/2019. I have 2 siblings - my
                2-minute older twin brother Clayton, and my 2-year younger sister, Kaitlyn. I also have
                3 stepbrothers and 1 stepsister – Chris, Matthew, Jacob, and Sarah.
            </p>
            <br>
            <p>
                I have 4 major passions in life – creating, designing, music, and dancing.
            </p>
            <br>
            <p>
                My first 2 passions were used in college for Graphic Design. Because of my love
                for video games, and my passions for creating and designing, this was an easy choice. My end goal was
                opening my own design studio to create and publish my own video games.
            </p>
            <br>
            <p>
                Those 2 passions turned to software development/engineering. With the knowledge of
                the 5 key principles of design: alignment, repetition, contrast, hierarchy,
                and balance, as well as color theory and typography, this is best demonstrated
                through my UI, UX, overall website and web application development.
            </p>
            <br>
            <p>
                The 3rd passion of mine is music. I can play 6 instruments: piano, alto, tenor,
                and baritone saxophone, as well as the bassoon, and French horn. In addition to
                that, I produce my own music and have monthly DJ streams on my Twitch.
            </p>
            <br>
            <p>
                My 4th passion is dancing, which combines the previous 3. I learned to swing dance,
                specifically the Lindy Hop in 2003, and for the last 18 years I’ve continued dancing.
                Up until 2014 as a member of a dance group I performed and competed on a semi-professional
                level, meaning I was never paid.
